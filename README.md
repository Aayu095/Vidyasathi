## 🔒 API Key Protection & Environment Setup

**API keys are securely managed through Supabase!**

* The chatbot uses Supabase Edge Functions to securely handle API requests
* API keys are stored as Supabase secrets and never exposed to the frontend
* To configure API keys:
  1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
  2. Navigate to Project Settings → Secrets
  3. Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret
  4. The Edge Functions automatically use these secrets securely

* For local development with Supabase CLI:
  ```bash
  supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

* No `.env` files needed - Supabase handles all environment configuration!

---

## 🚀 Deployment

* **Lovable Platform**: Use the built-in "Publish" button for instant deployment
* **Custom Domain**: Configure in Project Settings → Domains (requires paid plan)
* **GitHub Integration**: Connect to GitHub for automatic deployments to other platforms
* **Self-hosting**: Deploy the built app to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service
